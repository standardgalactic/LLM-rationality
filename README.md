Our paper consists of the forward modeling experiment (simulations and predictions) and an additional inverse modeling experiment (inferences from observing others). The forward_model, data, analysis, and open_sourced directories correspond to the forward modeling experiment. The inverse_model directory corresponds to the inverse modeling experiment. 

To run the experiments collecting data, use the following commands:

forward modeling: 

inverse modeling: 
./inverse_model/run_inverse.sh

To run analyses, use the following commands:

forward modeling: 

inverse modeling: 
./inverse_model/run_analysis.sh
